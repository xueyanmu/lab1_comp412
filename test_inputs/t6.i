Have you heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay,
that was built in such a logical way
it ran a hundred years to the day,
  and then, of a sudden, it - ah, but stay,
I'll tell you what happened without delay.
Scaring the parson into fits, 
frightening people out of their wits, - 
have you heard of that, I say?

(Introduction to Oliver Wendell Homes' poem
"The Deacon's Masterpiece, or the Wonderful One Hoss Shay")

BTW, well worth reading.
