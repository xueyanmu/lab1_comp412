COMP 412, Lab 1

This directory contains some small test programs (and T128k.i) 
intended to help you test and debug your ILOC Front End. 

The files include both valid ILOC codes and error-filled ILOC code.
A correct lab should do something reasonable with each of these files.

The grading program will use some of these files. It will also use
files that are not included in this set.
