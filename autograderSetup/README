COMP 412, Fall 2022

The tar file in this directory contains a scaled down version of the 
Lab 1 Autograder. To use it, create a new directory and unpack the tar 
file into the directory.  (That is, copy the L1AG.tar into the directory 
and run the command:

   tar xvf L1AG.tar

That should create several files, including 

   auto_grade 
   result
   README
   RunGrader
   TarFileGoesHere

Edit the file auto_grade/auto_grade.py and change the definition of 
"base_name" so that it points to the directory that contains the 
"RunGrader" file.  Note that "base_name" must end with a slash.

Before you run the autograder, you should know that the L1AG.tar 
includes a working tar file, comp412.tar, and a non-working tarfile, 
noway.tar. You should run the autograder once on these files to 
verify that it is functioning.

To run it, use the command:

   ./RunGrader

That should create a log file in the current directory, named with 
some long timestamp and ending with ".log". In the log file, you 
should see that noway failed to work and comp412 worked correctly
(no unexpected errors on the correct blocks and scores of 0 on the
erroneous inputs).

Now, delete the log file. If you want to delete the two test tar 
files, remove them from the directory "TarFileGoesHere". Copy your 
tar file into "TarFileGoesHere" and run the autograder again. The
log file should give you a reasonable picture of what happened.  
(Be certain that you are looking at the most recent log file. I 
always delete the log file before running the autograder.)

The autograder reports the results of testing in both the log file
and in two files in the results directory. Those files are tab-
delimited, but you may need to line up the data with the column headers.
