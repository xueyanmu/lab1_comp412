This software checks a tarfile to see if it vaguely conforms to the standard
for submission in COMP 412. To use the software, place the tar archive file
in the directory ./FilesToTest and then invoke the Verifier by typing 

  ./Verify 

The command will create, as output, a file name REPORT that should appear in
the current directory.

Examine REPORT to find your tarfile.

A correctly formed tarfile should result in the verifier discovering your
name, your netid, and reporting that it found the executable.

If it does not find these things, it will provide some rudimentary error
messages.

Missing name:  Either it did not find the README file or it did not 
find a properly formatted NAME: line.

Missing netid:  Either it did not find the README file or it did not
find a properly formatted NETID: line.

Failure to find the executable: If it found a makefile, the verifier
executed a "make clean" followed by a "make build" followed by a "make".
The results of the make are listed in the REPORT.

After trying to run make, it looked for the file '412fe'.  If it failed
to find the file, it reports an error.

NOTE: The verifier did not try to run your executable. Things could still
fail if the permissions are wrong or running ./412fe does not produce 
correct behavior.
